Each convolution is represented by Conv2d(K, OC, S), where K is the kernel size, OC is the number of output channels, and S is the stride.

The output size is shown following C $\times $ H $\times $ W notation, where C is the number of channels, H is the height, and W is the width. The inputs have shape $1 \times 64 \times 64$.
